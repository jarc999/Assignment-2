    <H2 class="header">About</H2>

    <p>ARCANA is a curatorial practice focused on documenting American subculture. Founded in 2020, bloomed in 2022. We believe that local scenes, promotors and crews are the ones keeping culture alive -- this work is rarely done alone, so we seek an approach that can highlight the collaborative and multifaceted nature of these projects. Whether it's negative attention from law enforcement or financial difficulties, we know how it feels to persevere against all odds. We're just here to celebrate anyone who's doing it. </p>
    <p>While interviews and photo documentation is our primary medium, we also occasionally host events, which you can view on our <a href="events.html">events</a> page.</p>
